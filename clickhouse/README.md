# Clickhouse

Clickhouse is an open-source column-oriented database management system (DBMS) that allows generating analytical data reports in real time. It is designed to process queries with low latency and high throughput, making it suitable for big data applications. Clickhouse is optimized for online analytical processing (OLAP) and is capable of handling petabytes of data with ease.

### Key Features of Clickhouse:

1. **Columnar Storage**: Unlike row-oriented databases that store data row by row, Clickhouse stores data in columns. This storage format is more efficient for analytical queries, which often aggregate data across many rows.

2. **Real-Time Data Processing**: Clickhouse is designed to handle real-time data processing. It can ingest data from various sources, process it, and make it available for querying almost instantly.

3. **High Performance**: Clickhouse is optimized for high performance. It can execute complex queries on large datasets with minimal latency. This is due to its efficient data storage and query processing mechanisms.

4. **Scalability**: Clickhouse is highly scalable. It can be deployed on a single server or across a cluster of servers to handle increasing data volumes and query loads.

5. **SQL Support**: Clickhouse supports SQL (Structured Query Language), allowing users to query data using familiar SQL syntax. This makes it easier for developers and analysts to work with the data.

6. **Data Compression**: Clickhouse uses various compression algorithms to reduce the storage space required for data. This is particularly beneficial for analytical databases where data is often stored for long periods.

7. **Replication and Sharding**: Clickhouse supports data replication and sharding, which helps in distributing data across multiple nodes for improved performance and reliability.

8. **Integration**: Clickhouse can be integrated with various data processing and analytics tools, making it a versatile choice for big data projects.

### Use Cases:

- **Real-time Analytics**: Clickhouse is ideal for applications that require real-time analytics, such as monitoring systems, fraud detection systems, and real-time dashboards.

- **Log and Event Data Analysis**: It's well-suited for analyzing log and event data, providing insights into user behavior, system performance, and more.

- **Ad Tech**: In the advertising industry, Clickhouse can be used to analyze clickstream data, enabling targeted advertising and personalized user experiences.

- **Financial Services**: Banks and financial institutions can use Clickhouse to analyze transaction data, detect fraud, and provide personalized financial services.




# Installation on Debian-based

## Step 1: Update Your System

First, ensure your system is up to date by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## Step 2: Install ClickHouse

As of my last update, ClickHouse does not provide a direct package for Ubuntu through the official Ubuntu repositories. However, you can install it from the official ClickHouse repository. Here's how:

1. **Add the ClickHouse Repository**:

   First, you need to add the ClickHouse repository to your system. You can do this by adding the repository's GPG key and then adding the repository itself.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv E0C56BD4

   echo "deb http://repo.clickhouse.com/deb/stable/ main/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clickhouse.list
   ```

2. **Update Your Package List**:

   After adding the repository, update your package list to include the new repository:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

3. **Install ClickHouse**:

   Now, you can install ClickHouse by running:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install clickhouse-server clickhouse-client
   ```

   This command installs both the ClickHouse server and the client, which you'll use to interact with the database.

## Step 3: Start ClickHouse

After installation, you need to start the ClickHouse server:

```bash
sudo service clickhouse-server start
```

## Step 4: Verify Installation

To verify that ClickHouse is installed and running correctly, you can use the ClickHouse client to connect to the server:

```bash
clickhouse-client
```

This command opens the ClickHouse client shell. You can then run SQL queries to interact with your database.

## Step 5: Configure ClickHouse (Optional)

Depending on your needs, you might want to configure ClickHouse further. The main configuration file is located at `/etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml`. You can edit this file to change various settings, such as the number of threads, memory limits, and more.


> **Note:** Default username and password is:

> 	* Password:[blank]

# Connect to `clickhouse-server`

To connect to ClickHouse using the `clickhouse-client` command-line tool, follow these steps. This guide assumes you have ClickHouse installed on your system and are familiar with using the terminal.

## Step 1: Open Your Terminal

- Open your terminal application. This could be Terminal on macOS, Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, or any terminal emulator on Linux.

## Step 2: Run `clickhouse-client`

- In the terminal, type the following command and press Enter:

 ```bash
 clickhouse-client
 ```

 This command opens the ClickHouse client shell. If your ClickHouse server is running on the same machine and doesn't require authentication, you'll be connected automatically.

## Step 3: Connect to ClickHouse Server (If Necessary)

- If your ClickHouse server requires authentication or is running on a different machine, you'll need to provide additional parameters to the `clickhouse-client` command.

- To specify a host and port, use the `--host` and `--port` options. For example, to connect to a ClickHouse server running on `localhost` at port `8123`, you would use:

 ```bash
 clickhouse-client --host localhost --port 8123
 ```

- If your ClickHouse server requires a username and password, you can use the `--user` and `--password` options. For example:

 ```bash
 clickhouse-client --host localhost --port 8123 --user your_username --password your_password
 ```

 Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with your actual ClickHouse username and password.

## Step 4: Execute Queries

- Once connected, you can start executing SQL queries directly in the shell. For example, to list all databases, type:

 ```sql
 SHOW DATABASES;
 ```

- To switch to a specific database, use:

 ```sql
 USE <database_name>;
 ```

- To list all tables in the current database, use:

 ```sql
 SHOW TABLES;
 ```

## Step 5: Exit the Client

- When you're done, you can exit the ClickHouse client by typing:

 ```sql
 exit
 ```

 or pressing `Ctrl+D`.

# Backup

## Backup to a local disk

- **Configure a backup destination:**

To prepare the destination add a file to /etc/clickhouse-server/config.d/backup_disk.xml specifying the backup destination.

```xml
<clickhouse>
    <storage_configuration>
        <disks>
            <YOUR_BACKUP_LABLE> <!-- your desire disk lable -->
                <type>local</type>
                <path>/PATH/TO/BACKUP/DIR/</path> <!-- remmeber to grant access to clickhouse user-->
            </YOUR_BACKUP_LABLE>
        </disks>
    </storage_configuration>
    <backups>
        <allowed_disk>YOUR_BACKUP_LABLE</allowed_disk> <!-- name of the disk you defined in disk section -->
        <allowed_path>/PATH/TO/BACKUP/DIR/</allowed_path>
    </backups>
</clickhouse>
```

> **Note:** `<backups>`, child of the `<disks>` tag, is the name of your backup disk,
>  you can use your naming convention

> **Note:** `<backups>`, child of the `<clickhouse>` tag, is 
> the list of backup `disk` and `path` configuration.

Real example:

## Add backup config

```bash
  tee /etc/clickhouse-server/config.d/backup.xml << EOF
<clickhouse>
    <storage_configuration>
        <disks>
            <backups>
                <type>local</type>
                <path>/mnt/clickhouse-backup/</path>
