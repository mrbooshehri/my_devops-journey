# Total bandwidth

Calculating the required bandwidth for a website involves estimating the amount of data that will be transferred between the website and its visitors over a specific period of time. Here's a basic formula to help you calculate the required bandwidth:

Bandwidth = (Average Page Views x Average Page Size x Average Daily Visitors x Number of Days in a Month) / (Seconds in a Day x 1,000,000)

Here's a breakdown of the variables in the formula:

1. Average Page Views: This is the average number of pages a visitor views during a session on your website.
2. Average Page Size: This is the average size of each page on your website in kilobytes (KB).
3. Average Daily Visitors: This is the average number of unique visitors your website receives in a day.
4. Number of Days in a Month: Typically 30 days.
5. Seconds in a Day: 86,400 (24 hours x 60 minutes x 60 seconds).
6. 1,000,000: This is used to convert kilobytes to megabytes.

By plugging in these values into the formula, you can estimate the required bandwidth for your website. Keep in mind that this is a basic formula and actual bandwidth requirements may vary based on factors such as peak traffic times, multimedia content, and other variables.

# Bandwidth according to user per second

To calculate the amount of bandwidth required based on the number of users per second accessing your website, you can use the following formula:

Bandwidth = (Average Page Views per User x Average Page Size x Users per Second) / 1,000,000

Here's a breakdown of the variables in the formula:

1. Average Page Views per User: This is the average number of pages a single user views during their session on your website.
2. Average Page Size: This is the average size of each page on your website in kilobytes (KB).
3. Users per Second: This is the number of users accessing your website per second.

By plugging in these values into the formula, you can estimate the required bandwidth based on the number of users per second accessing your website. Remember that this formula provides an estimate and actual bandwidth requirements may vary based on other factors such as peak traffic times and multimedia content.
