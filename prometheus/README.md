To install Prometheus on Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of Prometheus from the official website using the following command:

```bash
 wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.33.1/prometheus-2.33.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

2. Extract the downloaded file using the following command:

```bash
tar xvfz prometheus-2.33.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

3. Move the extracted directory to /usr/local using the following command:

```bash
sudo mv prometheus-2.33.1.linux-amd64 /usr/local/prometheus
```

4. Create a new user for Prometheus using the following command:

```bash
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false prometheus
```

5. Set the ownership of the Prometheus files to the newly created user using the following command:

```bash
sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/prometheus
```

6. Create libs directory and change the ownership to prometheus

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/lib/prometheus/
sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus/
```

7. Create a systemd service file for Prometheus using the following command:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
```

8. Paste the following configuration into the file:

```
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=prometheus
Group=prometheus
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/prometheus/prometheus --config.file=/usr/local/prometheus/prometheus.yml --storage.tsdb.path=/var/lib/prometheus/
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save and close the file.

8. Reload the systemd daemon using the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

9. Start the Prometheus service using the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start prometheus
```

10. Verify that Prometheus is running using the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status prometheus
```

11. Enable Prometheus to start at boot time using the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable prometheus
```

That's it! Prometheus should now be installed and running on your Ubuntu system. You can access the Prometheus web interface by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:9090.


Zabbix and Prometheus are both popular open-source monitoring and
alerting solutions used to monitor the performance and health of IT
infrastructure, applications, and services. They have distinct features
and capabilities that cater to different needs. Here's an overview of
each followed by a comparison:

**Zabbix:**
- Zabbix is a comprehensive monitoring solution that offers network
	monitoring, server monitoring, cloud monitoring, application
	monitoring, and more.
- It uses agents to collect data from monitored hosts and devices.
- Provides a user-friendly web interface for configuration, monitoring,
	and alerting.
- Supports various data collection methods, including SNMP, JMX, IPMI,
	agent-based, and more.
- Features a powerful trigger system to define alert conditions and
	actions.
- Offers visualization through graphs, maps, screens, and dashboards.
- Provides built-in reports and analysis tools.
- Supports automation and integrations with external tools and scripts.
- Suitable for medium to large-scale environments with complex
	monitoring needs.

**Prometheus:**
- Prometheus is a monitoring and alerting toolkit specifically designed
	for cloud-native environments and microservices.
- It uses a pull-based model where exporters are used to expose metrics,
	which are then collected by the Prometheus server.
- Employs a query language called PromQL for data querying and
	manipulation.
- Offers dynamic service discovery and automatic target configuration.
- Provides a basic web UI for visualization and querying.
- Designed for scalability and can handle large numbers of time series
	data.
- Integrates well with container orchestration platforms like
	Kubernetes.
- Supports alerting and notification through built-in alert manager.
- Well-suited for monitoring cloud-native applications and
	microservices.

**Comparison:**
- **Data Collection**: Zabbix uses agents for data collection, while
	Prometheus uses exporters to expose metrics.
- **Data Model**: Prometheus uses a time-series data model, whereas
	Zabbix uses a more flexible item-based approach.
- **Query Language**: Zabbix has a built-in query language, while
	Prometheus uses PromQL.
- **Alerting**: Both offer alerting and notification features, but
	Zabbix provides a more advanced trigger system.
- **Visualization**: Zabbix provides a more feature-rich and
	user-friendly visualization interface, while Prometheus offers a basic
	UI.
- **Scalability**: Prometheus is designed with scalability in mind,
	making it suitable for dynamic and large-scale environments.
- **Suitability**: Zabbix is suitable for traditional infrastructure and
	applications, while Prometheus excels in cloud-native and
	microservices environments.

Ultimately, the choice between Zabbix and Prometheus depends on your
specific monitoring needs, infrastructure, and technical preferences.
Zabbix provides a broader range of features, making it suitable for
diverse environments, while Prometheus is well-tailored for modern
cloud-native applications and microservices architectures.


Prometheus is generally considered to be better suited for monitoring
Kubernetes environments. Here's why:

1. **Native Integration**: Prometheus has native integration with
	 Kubernetes, making it easier to monitor Kubernetes components, pods,
	 nodes, and other resources. Kubernetes provides built-in support for
	 exposing metrics, which Prometheus can collect using its exporters.

2. **Dynamic Discovery**: Prometheus can dynamically discover and scrape
	 metrics from Kubernetes services and pods as they are created or
	 destroyed. This is especially useful in Kubernetes environments where
	 the number of instances may change frequently.

3. **PromQL**: Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) allows you to easily
	 query and aggregate metrics from your Kubernetes cluster, helping you
	 gain insights into performance, resource usage, and overall health.

4. **Alerting and Scaling**: Prometheus comes with a built-in alert
	 manager that can trigger alerts based on defined conditions. It's
	 also designed to handle large-scale monitoring environments, which is
	 important in Kubernetes clusters that can scale dynamically.

5. **Exporter Ecosystem**: The Prometheus ecosystem includes a wide
	 range of exporters and integrations for popular Kubernetes
	 components, such as kube-state-metrics, node-exporter, and more. This
	 allows you to monitor various aspects of your Kubernetes cluster out
	 of the box.

6. **Community and Adoption**: Prometheus has gained significant
	 adoption within the Kubernetes community and is widely used for
	 monitoring Kubernetes deployments. This means you'll find ample
	 resources, documentation, and community support.

While Zabbix can also be used to monitor Kubernetes, Prometheus is a
more natural fit due to its design, features, and native integration
with Kubernetes. However, it's important to evaluate both options based
on your specific monitoring requirements and familiarity with the tools
before making a decision.
