# what is Certbot
Certbot it's free, open source software tool for automatically using [Let's
encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates on manually-administrated
websites to enable HTTPS. The appeal of Certbot is that you run it once
automatically get free HTTPS certificates forever. You can install it as a
service on virtual machines even work with cloud providers like Azure where you
are running your web application as a PaaS service and you don't have terminal
access.
