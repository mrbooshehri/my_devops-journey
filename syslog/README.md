# Syslog

Rsyslog is a GPL-ed, enhanced syslogd. Among others, it offers support
for reliable Syslog over TCP, writing to MySQL databases, and fully
configurable output formats (including great timestamps). Rsyslog was
initiated by Rainer Gerhards, GroBrinderfeld.

The earlier world was using either one of the following

* The stock syslogd, e.g sysklogd
* Syslog-ng
* Another-solution

So basically, Rainer Gerhardâ€™s club everything in another solution and
created a new Syslog called rsyslog.
