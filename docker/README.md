**Note:** Docker offers good solutions to manage microservice based
applications. 

## DevOps
DevOps is a culture, movement or practice that emphasizes the
**collaboration** and **communication** of both software developers and
other IT professionals while **automating the process of software
delivery and infrastructure changes.**  
DevOps is a **cultural** and operational model that fosters
**collaboration** to enable high-performance **IT** to achieve
**business goals**

**Artifact:** It's the production of development side. It can be a jar
file or even a docker image or etc. The operation side deploy the
artifact.

DevOps fills the gap between developers and operation unit. It tends to
find the best and easiest practice that connect development unit and
operation unit(to share the artifact, at least)

## Continues Integration(CI)
CI is a software development practice which frequently refers to
integrating, building and testing code within the development
environment.

Benefits of CI
* If you are going to fail, then fail early
* Increase confidence in the software
* Team communication
* Risk mitigation

CI pipeline
* Build
* Unit tests
* Integration tests

### Continues Delivery(CD)
* Continues Delivery is about putting the release schedule in the hands
of the business, not in the hands of IT.
* Making sure you software is always production ready throughout its
	entire lifecycle that any build could potentially be released to
	users.

Benefits of CD
* It helps in time reduction

CD pipeline
* Review
* Staging
* Production

### Continues Deployment
All the process form	code to production handel by automation
mechanisms, if you do anything manually from staging to production it's
not continues deployment anymore, it's continues delivery.
