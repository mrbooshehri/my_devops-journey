# Session 1

**Note:** Docker offers good solutions to manage microservice based
applications. 

## DevOps
DevOps is a culture, movement or practice that emphasizes the
**collaboration** and **communication** of both software developers and
other IT professionals while **automating the process of software
delivery and infrastructure changes.**  
DevOps is a **cultural** and operational model that fosters
**collaboration** to enable high-performance **IT** to achieve
**business goals**

**Artifact:** It's the production of development side. It can be a jar
file or even a docker image or etc. The operation side deploy the
artifact.

DevOps fills the gap between developers and operation unit. It tends to
find the best and easiest practice that connect development unit and
operation unit(to share the artifact, at least)

## Continues Integration(CI)
CI is a software development practice which frequently refers to
integrating, building and testing code within the development
environment.

Benefits of CI
* If you are going to fail, then fail early
* Increase confidence in the software
* Team communication
* Risk mitigation

CI pipeline
* Build
* Unit tests
* Integration tests

### Continues Delivery(CD)
* Continues Delivery is about putting the release schedule in the hands
of the business, not in the hands of IT.
* Making sure you software is always production ready throughout its
	entire lifecycle that any build could potentially be released to
	users.

Benefits of CD
* It helps in time reduction

CD pipeline
* Review
* Staging
* Production

### Continues Deployment
All the process form	code to production handel by automation
mechanisms, if you do anything manually from staging to production it's
not continues deployment anymore, it's continues delivery.

# Session 2

## Monolithic Architecture
A monolithic architecture is where all required logic and components are
located within one unit (a war, a jar, a single application, one
repository)

## Pros and cons of monolithic architecture
Pros:
* Simple delivery
* Simple test
* Simple deploy

Cons:
* The size of the application can slow down the start-up time
* Difficulty to adopt new and advanced technology. Since changing in
	language or framework affect an entire application
* Maintenance, it's difficult to make change fast and correctly
* Reliability, bug in any module can potentially bring down the entire
	process

## Microservice Architecture
An application is built in smaller, separate pieces. Each service is
developed, tested and deployed independently. This architecture works
with API gateway to communicate with customers and response to their
requests.

### Pros and cons of microservice architecture
Pros:
* Faster and simpler deployment and rollback
- Independent scalable services
* Microservice enables the continues delivery and deployment of large
	and complex applications
* Improve fault isolation
* Technology diversity

Cons:
* Increase network communication
* Additional complexity in testing and distributed system
* Deployment complexity

## What is docker
Docker is a containerization platform that package your application and
all its dependencies together in the form of a docker container to
ensure that your application works seamlessly in any environment

## What is a docker image
A docker image is a collection of all the files that make up an
executable software application. This collection includes the
application plus all the libraries, binaries, and other dependencies
just needed to run the application anywhere.

### Docker image architecture(layered architecture)
* Docker image followed a layered architecture
* Layers are reusable and share
* Rebuilding the image will be faster
* Files in the layers are read-only
* If you chose to alter the content of your image, the only valid docker
	option is adding another layer with the new changes
* Docker images have a parent-child relationship
* The bottom-most image is called the base-image that doesn't have any
	parent

**Note:** We cannot run widows-based containers on Linux, because they
use different kernel. So to run that kind of containers you need to run
that on docker in a windows machine.

### What is a docker container
A container is a runnable instance of an image. It is a standard unit of
software packages up code and all its dependencies, so the application
runs quickly and reliably from one computer environment to another.

### What is a docker registry
It's a place that docker images can be stored in order to publicly or
privately found and accessed. Docker registry can be hosted by a
third-party as a publicly or privately registry like:
1. Docker hub
1. Quay
1. Google container registry
1. AWS container registry

Image registries contain multiple image repository. In turn, image
registries can contain multiple images(also different versions of an
image).

**Note:** Container is a process on your host machine.
