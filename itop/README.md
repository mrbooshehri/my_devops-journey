# What is iTop?
iTop, stands for IT Operational Portal, is an Open Source web based application for the day to day operations of an IT environment. iTop was designed with the ITIL best practices in mind but does not dictate any specific process, the application is flexible enough to adapt to your processes whether you want rather informal and pragmatic processes or a strict ITIL aligned behaviour.

This tool is ideal for Help Desk agents, Support engineers, Service managers, IT managers and End-users. Hence it is based on Apache, MySQL and PHP, so you can run it on any operating system that supports those applications like Windows, Linux, MacOS and Solaris as well.

Using iTop you can:

* Document your entire IT infrastructure assets such as servers, applications, network devices, virtual machines, contacts.. etc.
* Manage incidents, user requests, planned outages.
* Document IT services and contracts with external providers including service level agreements.
* Export all the information in a manual or scripted manner.
* Import or synchronize/federate any data from external systems.

# Software configuration

## Write permission on temp directory
iTop needs write access to the temp dir (this path is retrieved using
the PHP function ```sys_get_temp_dir()```). Check rights and also the
```openbase_dir``` PHP parameter !

## PHP
Recommanded valuse for ```php.ini```
```php
memory_limit = 256M ; could be increased if needed
max_input_vars = 5000
 
; upload_tmp_dir : should point to a directory with write access
 
; also check those options for attachments (se dedicated chapter below)
; adapt values depending of your preferences!
; - upload_max_filesize
; - max_file_uploads
; - post_max_size
; - max_input_time
```
**Note:** If you're using CLI tools like cron.php, check also the PHP instance used for CLI !
